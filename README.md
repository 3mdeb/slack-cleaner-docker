# slack-cleaner-docker

# TODO

* [slack-downloader](https://github.com/3mdeb/slack-downloader) script is not
  flexible at all. Consider using
  [feature of slack-cleaner](https://github.com/sgratzl/slack-cleaner/issues/33)
  instead.

* Fix success check in the entrypoint.sh script

* Release and push to dockerhub
